                        Story about cats
                    </h2>

                         <p> Cats are fascinating creatures, known for their independence, unique personalities, and charming behaviors. Whether you’re a lifelong cat lover or considering adopting one for the first time, cats make great companions for a variety of reasons.</p>
                         
                         <p>
                         Unlike other domesticated animals, cats were never bred to serve a specific role beyond companionship and pest control. Their independent nature, combined with their ability to co-exist with humans, made them well-suited for living in homes. Over thousands of years, the relationship between humans and cats grew into one of mutual respect and affection, and today, cats are cherished as loving pets and companions in homes all over the world. </p>

                         <p>
                           The origin of domestic cats (Felis catus) is a fascinating story that spans thousands of years. Cats were once wild animals that gradually formed a bond with humans, leading to their domestication. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                           Agricultural Revolution: About 10,000 years ago, humans began transitioning from hunter-gatherers to settled agricultural communities in the Near East (modern-day Iraq, Syria, and Turkey). This shift led to the storage of grain and other food supplies.
                           Rodents and Cats: The stored grain attracted rodents, which in turn attracted wildcats looking for an easy food source. Cats began to hang around human settlements in search of food, leading to a natural mutual relationship. 
                           Humans didn’t domesticate cats intentionally at first, but they likely appreciated the cats for keeping the rodent population under control.

                           Kittens are the adorable, playful, and curious baby cats that are loved by many for their sweet personalities and tiny, fluffy features. Kittens are typically remain in the juvenile stage until they are about 9–12 months old. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           Kittens are born blind and deaf. Their eyes and ears are closed, and they rely entirely on their sense of smell and touch to find their mother. They begin to open their eyes at around 7-10 days, but their vision is blurry at first. They also start responding to sounds around 2 weeks.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           Kittens are born with blue eyes, but their eye color can change as they age. Most adult cats have green, yellow, or amber eyes. The "kneading" behavior (pushing their paws in and out on soft surfaces) is something kittens learn from their mother, as it mimics the action of nursing. It’s often carried into adulthood as a sign of comfort and affection.
